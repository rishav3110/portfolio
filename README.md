# portfolio
It is my first project in webdesign. I have made a portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS 
taught in the GDSC web blitz3.0 work shop. I have also leant about some new tags and CSS attribute like hover and box shadow.
The css and html files are made separately and linked using <link> tag.
I have not used any javascript in this websit but i want to upgrade it in future.
